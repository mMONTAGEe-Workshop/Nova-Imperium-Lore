 <h1>Denton Patreus Stability Crumbling!</h1>
 <h2>The top admiral of the Imperial Navy is unable to maintain peace and order among his territories. The murderer of Kaeso Mordanticus can't control his systems. While this may not be a surprise to all of us, it is quite impressive nonetheless. The factions that support Denton have lost control of many a system and are unable to effectively counterattack.</h2>
 <h2>While the admiral can't openly ask Hadrian Augustus Duval or the Nova Navy for help, there have been some backchannel discussions between Nova Navy Praetors and prominent supporters of Denton Patreus. The results of these discussions have led to the mutual decision that Nova Paresa, supported by the Nova Navy, should step in to return Denton's holdings to their previously peaceful states. Nova Paresa does not forget what Denton Patreus has done in the past. However, if their presence can stabilize more of the Empire, then it is only right and just for the citizens of those systems to be embraced by Hadrian Augustus Duval and Nova Paresa.</h2>
 <h2>Speaking under the condition of anonymity, an unofficial source has suggested that this play by Hadrian Augustus Duval could result in him strengthening his position on the Imperial stage.</h2>
 <h2>The Nova Navy is asking all active pilots to help in the task to stabilize Patreus' systems. Those with any questions on how they can better help should open their comms panel and send a communique to a Praetor of the Nova Navy. In the name of Hadrian Augustus Duval and Kaeso Mordanticus, I personally hope that the Nova Navy can quickly and decisively bring peace back to these terrorized systems.</h2>
