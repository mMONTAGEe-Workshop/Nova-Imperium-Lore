 <h1>Denton Patreus Stability Crumbling!</h1>
 <h2>The top admiral of the Imperial Navy is unable to maintain peace and order among his territories. The murderer of Kaeso Mordanticus can't control his systems. While this may not be a surprise to all of us, it is quite impressive nonetheless. The factions that support Denton have lost control of many a system and are unable to effectively counterattack.</h2>
 <h2>While the admiral can't openly ask Hadrian Augustus Duval or the Nova Navy for help, there have been some backchannel discussions between Nova Navy Praetors and prominent supporters of Denton Patreus. The results of these discussions have led to the mutual decision that Nova Paresa, supported by the Nova Navy, should step in to return Denton's holdings to their previously peaceful states. Nova Paresa does not forget what Denton Patreus has done in the past. However, if their presence can stabilize more of the Empire, then it is only right and just for the citizens of those systems to be embraced by Hadrian Augustus Duval and Nova Paresa.</h2>
 <h2>Speaking under the condition of anonymity, an unofficial source has suggested that this play by Hadrian Augustus Duval could result in him strengthening his position on the Imperial stage.</h2>
 <h2>The Nova Navy is asking all active pilots to help in the task to stabilize Patreus' systems. Those with any questions on how they can better help should open their comms panel and send a communique to a Praetor of the Nova Navy. In the name of Hadrian Augustus Duval and Kaeso Mordanticus, I personally hope that the Nova Navy can quickly and decisively bring peace back to these terrorized systems.</h2>

     <h1>Denton Patreus Supporters Praise Nova Navy Pilots!</h1>
     <h2>The Nova Navy and Nova Paresa have quickly and professionally stepped in to uphold peace in the Empire. Nova Navy Pilots have been working around the clock to stabilise Denton Patreus' territories. The effort displayed has been absolutely amazing to behold. Both new and experienced pilots have put in so much work and have truly exemplified what it means to be a loyal Imperial citizen.</h2>
     <h2>This praise from Denton's proponents comes as Nova Paresa expanded into the Cemplangpa system. The recalcitrant elements in the system have been removed after much toil and bloodshed. While there were some casualties to the civilian populace, the residents of the system are glad that they will once again be able to sleep and work and live in peace in short order.</h2>
     <h2>Nova Paresa and the Nova Navy are not done yet. There are other systems with uncooperative factions that must be removed. However, I believe that all Imperial citizens can agree that restoration of peace is worth any amount of effort. Backers of Denton Patreus hope that all Nova Navy pilots keep up their wonderful work and protect his citizens.</h2>
