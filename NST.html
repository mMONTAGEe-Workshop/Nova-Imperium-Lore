  <h1>Nova Science Team in Indri</h1>
  <h2>In the Indri System, with the support of both sides of the Empire and the Alliance, the Nova Science Team was founded as a faction, supported by resources from Paresa and financially from the alliance. Their task now is to focus on the study of the Thargoids and help the scientific part of the galaxy with knowledge.

    Not close but not very far from the currently three systems under Thargoid attack. With the help of the Nova Navy and Nova Science Team, a fleet of anti-Thargoid fighters set out for the Tekkeitjal system. Also At the moment, Deep Space Research is exploring and observing three unknown objects that have spawned unnoticed and unexpectedly.
    Gerard Aghaius congratulated Wells and sent troops to the military outpost to strengthen our position and influence after which
    Soon to be selected members of the Science Party Assembly Council, the Assembly's Chief Speaker was chosen by NST founder Harrison Wells.</h2>
    <h2>Guardians specialist and researcher "Yumasai" commented:
      "The establishment of the Nova Science Team is a great boon to the system of Indri through the resources the forces of Hadrian Duval have spent on establishing the research institute in such an advantageous location to enhance studies into the Thargoid species. I find it sad but also not totally unsurprising that the locals are opposed to the arrival of us Imperials.
      
      To ensure the safety and security of the researchers and their families, I have sent a detachment of the Hadriani Detainment Company to the system to speak with Imperial authorities and handle any major criminals that arise amongst the discontent masses. We strive to resolve our differences in a civil way, not through disrupting the order by instigating a civil war like this petty little group of rioters does."</h2>
      <h2>"Independent Indri Revolutionary Party" Disagrees with the presence of Imperial representatives in the system and threatened war, at the moment there is a civil war between both. Destiny and the Nova Paresa fleet came to the rescue to strengthen the treaty and their influence.

        Hadrian Duval was disappointed that we desecrated his word of isolation but still received a lot of support from the people and Hadrian's Wife</h2>

  <h2>The "Independent Indri Revolutionary Party" did not last a day as Nova Paresa crushed their attack on the Nova Science Team.

    By signing an agreement between both parties, it was agreed that the military station would come under the control of the NST.
    
    There were detentions and victims, they were redirected to the nearest hospitals of the Alliance.
    The Hadriani Detainment Company has arrested quite a few hundred people for attacking Faction personnel and attempting to sabotage Destiny, and they face further trials that the NST cannot influence.
    
    On planet A 1, the System Gem, they are planning to build a base for a negotiation between the Empire-Federation-Alliance to prevent future misunderstandings and chaos in the system. Federation representatives are unhappy but agreed. Both parties were invited to the Assembly of Scientific Party of Nova Science Team.</h2>

  <h2>In the Indri System, the controlling faction of the system had a sudden change of government, the Democratic Party of the faction was forcibly overthrown.
    This event has worried everyone in the system.</h2>
  <h2>The NST Security Division called an urgent Assembly meeting to discuss the situation of Future Of Udegoci. Instead of them were temporarily invited the Xelabara Republic Party as a representative of the friendly system and the Alliance. Democratic Future of Udegoci was represented by them.
    The NST Security Division provided evidence of armed groups, It was also provided that the acquisition of weapons purchased from the nearest systems of the Independent anarchists
    </h2>
  <h2>Hayk Cooper, Assembly Secretary
    '''I was asked to convey that the purchase of weapons in such quantities is perceived as a Provocation and an attempt to destabilize the system. After Consulting with the Security Division, Federation and Alliance representatives came up with a resolution called "Peace", Military intervention to prevent a terrorist attack and help free the faction.

  <h1>Victory, System security guarantor, Secret mission...</h1>
  <h2>And then the day came when the united forces defeated the armed group. Future of Udegoci will have to recover for a very long time, it cannot lead the system and guarantee security.

    As previously planned in the Assembly, a referendum was held on who will be the guarantor of the system's security, Nova Science Team (Security Division), Independent Indri Revolution Party, Indri Life PLC participated in this.
    
    During the voting in the Assembly Independent Indri Revolution Party and the opposition, accusations were made against the NST that the NST were hiring mercenaries to fight with them and take control of the system for themselves.
    Photo evidences were provided with camera screenshots with possible "suspect"
    
    NST speakers refuted this note, calling it falsification and nonsense when there is a Security Disivion assisted from Nova Navy.</h2>

    <h2>
      The news quickly spreaded across news channels.
      "People wonder how a science team can field so many soldiers. Rumor has it NST has hired criminals to fight for them as mercenaries but such claims are debunked by NST as fake and fabricated news"</h2>
      <h2>Oppositions of NST have released publicly a mugshot of an alleged mercenary working for NST, but, NST has claimed that it is a fabricated image without strong proof behind it. For privacy reasons NST has applied a blur.</h2>

    <h2>Despite all this, the Nova Science Team won most of the votes. Indri Revolutionary party was publicly ridiculed.

      Citizen of Indri-
      "These people were able to drive out the armed terrorists and protect us, we have not had such power for a long time, these people showed that they can lead our system, people with a lot of support from Nova Paresa."</h2>
      <br>
    <h2>During the conflict, the Nova Paresa embassy was overwhelmed with applications for Faction citizenship, during which time the first Indri-Tetone flight was sent as a token of the friendship of the systems.

      Ambassador Xelabara was convened to discuss the future representatives of the alliance in the system at the same time the Udegoci enemy forces were arrested, war crimes investigations were launched against the terrorist group that intercepted the Future of Udegoci, constantly bombarding settlements with large calibers and mortars.
      
      On this day, 10/10/3308, a monument was erected in honor of all those who died during this war on the planet indri C 1, Eternal memory to these heroes. The wars did not end there, Xelabara and Indri Life PLC came into conflict with each other, the reasons are unknown and will be discussed during the System Meeting Assemble.
      
      Harrison and representatives forwarded a letter through NST Ambassador Cibola to Victor Dangerstar Nova Navy Praetor, CMDR Jeremaya, Harumune, Shakaka, Seth Furry and a personal message to an old friend. In gratitude, in the Indri System on our pearl A 1 Planet, a feast is announced and everyone are invited to this holiday.
      
      Secret Mission
      During a secret meeting with the participation of Harrison Wells, it was unanimously decided to assassinate the organizer of the terrorist attack on the Indri system, Codenamed "Pour the wine" A man with the nickname "Tehler" was chosen for this murder, the target was the leader of this armed group.
      The target fled to the HR 6421 system where he came from, hoping to avoid punishment in the chaos of anarchy in this system.
      Tehler tracked him down and waited for the right moment. And the time came, he went right in front of the leader and shot one bullet right in the head. Success, he only had to escape from his pursuers.
      some law enforcement officers remained in the system and caught him. In court, he was convicted of murder and sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years. By order of the Nova Science Team, a delegation was sent to this system to negotiate on the assignment of Tehler under our control. Returning home, he was released from all prejudice and awarded the medal of the hero.</h2>

  <h1>Scanner near Cibola...?</h1>
  <h2>During special work for Nova Paresa, CMDR Jeremaya discovered something that it would be impossible, not far from the Cibola system, a fragment was found that belongs to the Thargoid Sensor class, The news spread pretty quickly between Nova Paresa, and of course it got to Indri.

    The Nova Science Team came to the Cibola system to discuss the found artifact,
    Basic inspection showed that this sensor did not work, but that does not mean that it does not pose a danger.
    with the latest Thargoid escalations and the appearance of 3 more Stargoids, it's very possible this thing could transmit a signal at any moment.</h2>
  <h2>
    It is very dangerous to transport this thing in a regular ship, so NST decided to send the group to the planet itself. A group with special cargo ships protected from corrosion are being prepared and will arrive in the system in the coming days to safely remove this thing and destroy it once and for all.
    Through Indri Life PLC we asked Federal galactic Archive to provide us public copy of Thargoid sensor.</h2>

  <h1>Suspicions are rising</h1>
  <h2>After the operation to eliminate the scanner on the planet Quivira, more scanners were discovered.

    This adds to the danger concern because an eighth UIA was recently discovered nearby. As mentioned earlier, even though the scanners are disabled, they still pose a danger. The team from Indri has not left the system and is currently stationed at Sansebar in orbit around the planet Quivira.</h2>
  <h2>Destiny had to leave the system due to readiness for a re-invasion in other system, but still continues to send help to the team.

    This time, instead of destroying the scanner, the decision was made to deliver this scannet to Destiny for storage, and send an observation team to the other scanner. Settlers on the planet Quivira are advised to be on the alert for any xeno threat, given that more and more UIA's are found.
    
    Qi Hydrophonics Market offered to help the observation team by providing temporary housing, after these words, xenobiologists arrived with Harrison Wells to study the remains of the scanner on the planet and the history of the appearance of this scanner on the planet Quivira.</h2>
  <h2>Wells will meet with representatives of Nova Paresa on the snowy planet Keytree to discuss the situation in the system and congratulate Nova Paresa on finally controlling this System.</h2>

  <h1>Final Conclusion.</h1>
  <h2>Delving further into the history of the appearance of this scanner in the Cibola system, a good clue is that usually thargoids leave scanners in systems where there are planets -></h2>
  <li>with an ammonium atmosphere and liquid methane oceans</li>
  <li>gas giants rich in ammonium and carry life based on ammoniac.</li>
  <h2>There is one gas giant in the System that is little studied, they say that there are microorganisms of the ammonium class, this should not be missed because every detail is important.
    At the request of a team of exobiologists, a ship equipped with a Deep Surface Scanner was sent. Far around this gas giant in orbit there is a small station where mostly people live under the supervision of the judiciary, quite guarded. To gain access to get closer to the planet, it was necessary for a tedious hour, after which the ship set off for the planet.
    
    Meanwhile, on the snow planet Keytree, a Nova Paresa-sponsored tour of the construction of a new city was held. The facility for training of Nova Navy soldiers was introduced under supervision of Gerard Aghaius together with New Imperial Military tech showcase. Harrison Wells participated in the opening of a joint educational facility between Nova Science Team and Nova Paresa named after Hector Duval. Because of the coming snowfall, we had to hide under cover and wait for the end of the storm so that we could safely leave the planet.</h2>
  <h2>Returning back to Sansebar, the ship brought back positive results from the presence of ammonium, as well as samples of bacterial life in the upper layers of the gas giant. This proved the main reason for the presence of the Scanner in the Cibola system, Thargoid tends to leave Scanners behind when exploring systems that contain an Amonium Planet for future plans for possible colony, but this does not answer the question why they were only now discovered. Due to numerous requests from the local population, it was decided to temporarily leave the observation team in the Cibola system for the safety of people until the unknown threat 8 UIA's disappear, Destiny has already returned to the Indri system with the rest of the scanner in storage.</h2>

  <h1>Observation Team Member Sabotaged.</h1>
  <h2>On October 28, 3308, a member of the Xeno Scanner Observation Team and a citizen of Paresa were murdered in the Cibola system while transporting the scanner wreckage to the planet KeyTree behind the newly built city at the planet's pole. Due to severe snowfalls and storms, the body was discovered after two days completely frozen closer to the Cibola Blue Dynamic Exchange settlement.

    A criminal investigation has been initiated and a letter of complaint has been sent to Cibola Blue Dynamic Exchange demanding clarification of what is going on. The Security Division of Nova Science Team was not present in the System, instead their own police was in the system, NST had to request permission to conduct a personal investigation by the scientific Assembly of the murder.
    
    Victim Is Sophia Melpomene, 35.
    The cargo was being delivered from Refined Software Scientific to the City prior to the assassination. Presumably, the attacker was aiming to turn off the engines of the rushing ship at full speed; the discovered black box also revealed a breakdown in the ship's control system. A photo of what was allegedly a pre-death attempt to record a message was left on a discovered camera next to the body.

  <h2>No response was received from the CBDE, refusing to cooperate and the fact that they did not announce the discovery of the body a day after the storm subsided, but was found by a random voyager from Miquitagat. With the rise of the "Xeno-Peace Project" activists they're likely participants of that, they were listed in "Faction non-grata". Sanctioning threats from Nova Paresa to punish them helped to partly split them and see information as the probable cause of the murder.

    Nova Science Team will pay Sophia's family as sign of Solidarity, Observation Team continues to monitor scanners in the Pole City.</h2>

    Citizens also demanded the representatives of the three superpowers to come out and talk to the people.</h2>
  <h2>Osian Powers, member of assembly, Federation.</h2>
  <li>"It's time for us to apologize to them and get on the road to a peaceful life with them, but it can't happen so quickly, we have a lot to overcome."</li>
  <h2>Harrison Wells, General Speaker of Assembly, Empire.</h2>
  <li>"I'm not sure what to say, such a choice is quite tricky, as long as we actively deploy guardian -based weapons the thargoids will perceive us unfriendly, we have twice tried to destroy them for personal gain and so-called "security", we know little about their technology and how to communicate with them.
    We created a megaship as a sign of peace, but what did it give? Just recently, California Nebula was attacked and what was the first thing the federation thought? Meta-alloy farms are under threat. If we continue to exploit their resources for our own benefit in their territories, we will not achieve peace ."</li>

    In the Mikoyan City she was met by Harrison's best friend since childhood. Harrison couldn't come from a meeting with the observation team at Cibola.
    The Destiny fleet carrier, she had heard a lot about his beloved ship, The friend told Harrison that her mother had finally arrived and was preparing to visit Destiny. Everyone knows that you can’t trample on the word of the mother and Harrison was already on the fleet carrier.</h2>
    <h2>
      "Welcome to Destiny, Mrs. Sahakyan", She was greeted by the captain of the carrier and escorted to the office on the second floor. Seeing him sitting in his chair, finally doing the job he dreamed of in the ship he wanted so much. After so many years, they finally met, who had been separated by the first war of Paresa, was finally able to see each other again. in her eyes one could see the fear and pain of the past and the growing fear of the impending unknown. Stargoids are getting closer to the bubble of humanity every second, fear is growing every day. Some people are gearing up in self-defense, others are preparing to negotiate with the Thargoids.
      
      The family moved temporarily to live on Destiny under the protection of the Security Division. They decided not to stand on the sidelines and also participate in the Destiny Expedition to extract the blueprints and ancient knowledge of the Guardians in order to create more weapons based on their technology for self-defense, the Expedition will help the Nova Navy warriors with their struggle to defend the Empire in the face of the rumors of the aggressive response of the impending Thargoids. The Cibola System is already preparing a crew, with 720 tons of Tritium ordered from Sansebar Station to charge the Hyperdrives of Destiny.</h2>
    <h2>-Kalia Power and Dasha Daniels gave joint statement regarding the expedition

    Harrison on board Destiny met a man who spreads fear into living souls, Hellrider, who came to help in this mission. He is always there when it comes to traveling and exploring, in the office on the bridge they discussed a retreat plan if the bubble defense failed. Before he left, he gave Harrison messages from Victor, a blueprint for a possible Anti-Xeno capital ship to be produced at the three Nova Paresa factories. The prototype needs a large amount of material from guardians to produce huge gauss canons. During the HIP war, experimental weapons proved to be good in action, but this was not enough, you need weapons that destroy and not paralyze. The blueprint needs to be polished and discussed with the engineering team at Serrod Drive Yards.</h2>
    <img src="img/NST/hellmont.png">
  <h2>The commander under the nickname "Small Molecule" was already sitting in the bar, he was waiting for his friend. Harrison and Hellrider also came to the bar a couple of minutes later. They drank with a smile on the success of the mission entrusted to us.</h2>
  <h2>At the office on the bridge, Harrison gave them the documents on the location of the guardian ruins, how they work, and how to activate the guardian orb.</h2>
<h2>The first blueprint we needed was a weapon one. In Synuefe EU-Q c21-10 on planet A 3, Harrison escorted them to the ruins of the guardians and went on his own business to the nearest planets to study exobiology in the hope of using them in the treatment of xeno infection

  Harrison has often been nicknamed "The Planet Wanderer" since childhood due to his curiosity to study the mysteries hidden on these planets. and this helped him more than once to learn more about the planets for nova paresa.</h2>
<h2>Temporarily settling on the planet, he established a connection with Dasha Daniels and transmitted a request to prepare storage facilities for xeno artifacts. The first batch has already arrived on Destiny and is being stored.</h2>

  <h2>I don't understand what happened, I just woke up in a pile of metal under the rubble. I can't breathe the suit is pierced, I see fire and sirens. Something poisonous seems to penetrate my lungs, poisoning me and I can’t recognize this smell. I can't move if someone reads the last time I was on a Destiny ship i don't remember station name i docked at i'm attempting to share my coordinates, there isn't much oxygen left I don't know how long I can last until I burn alive or get poisoned.</h2>
<h2>Rescue megaships appeared in some systems, and Harrison Wells was delivered on one of them. He was found after receiving an SOS message under the rubble next to explosive substances. He was taken to the rescue ship Hutner.</h2>
<h2>"On the verge of death, everything happened unexpectedly. Standing in the corridor, I hear a familiar scream and after a couple of minutes everything around me explodes and nailed me with a pile of metal, my legs were pierced and my helmet was scattered, I thought it would all be over, before that I sent an SOS Message and hope for help , everything is on fire, everywhere screams ... the unexpected overtook me, the only thing that saved me was the adhesive tape with which to seal the leak ... I was saved by professional rescuers ... ".</h2>
<h2>"I couldn't look at myself from the burns in the mirror, the only way to cope I came up with was to put on a helmet of full blackout. The first action was to personally go on reconnaissance, the communication systems were very junk, it was almost impossible to get in touch with Nova Paresa, thargoids were teeming everywhere... Almost felt no where to hide. In Witchspace I was intercepted by a Medusa-class thargoid, without hesitation, the alien opened fire, I had to flee, I was not in the right ship. An unfortunate incident happened when I visited the Taranis cloud, spilled past an unknown mechanical structure, an explosion occurred and the engine was damaged, and in short, somehow got out in the first place, it detonates whenever something with heat passes by, so can say it's heatseeking mine"</h2>
<h2>"Now, the main unity of humanity is important, we need to protect humanity from the thargoids, now only one Stargoid has arrived and already such losses now imagine what will happen when the remaining 7 arrive ... I am now, one might say, in combat positions, Destiny provides all commanders with a safe place in the Senocidi system."</h2>

  <h1>Nova Science Team and Iron Phoenix Enterprise partnership.</h1>
  <h2>The Destiny fleet carrier finally arrived at Colonia after days of travelling the galaxy. Harrison Wells, the leader of Nova Science Team, had been eagerly waiting to meet with the local businesswoman, who had helped establish contact with Iron Phoenix Enterprise. A faction that has long been of interest to the Nova Science Team and received financial support. The goal was to explore a potential mutual partnership that would benefit both parties.</h2>
  <h2>As the crew disembarked from crew's Beluga liner, they were greeted by the warm smile of Harrison's mother, who had been living in Colonia for many years. She hugged her son tightly and introduced him to the businesswoman, who was known for her sharp business acumen and ability to make deals that benefitted everyone.</h2>
  <h2>The trio then headed to a nearby conference room where they met with the representatives of Iron Phoenix Enterprise and the Nova Science Team in Farwell system, home of Phoenix. After several hours of discussion and negotiation, both parties came to an agreement. Iron Phoenix Enterprise would send its representatives to Indri, and in turn, Nova Science Team would send its representatives to Farwell. They would also sign an agreement for mutual benefaction and Nova Science Team would provide Nova Paresan developed technology to help the planetary colony grow. And In exchange, They will provide scientific reports on exobiology in the inner-scutum-centaurus-arm region and the efficiency of agriculture on the planets of this region. This was announced by the new appointments of Ambassador of Farwell to Indri. Ambassador of NST, also confirmed the readiness to provide improved equipment for the study of flora in the galaxy</h2>
  <h2>Harrison was ecstatic about the partnership He had always been passionate about potential of Iron Phoenix Enterprise. from personally financially supporting to creating partnerships on larger scale.</h2>
  <h2>As the negotiations concluded, Harrison made a call to his good friends at Brewer Company. They had been working on the Colonia Bridge, and Harrison contributed alot to them with some of the technical and material aspects. As a result, he had made good friends and contacts in the area.</h2>
  <h2>Harrison negotiated with them if they could provide a Bulk-Class megaship for a lowered price, which would be used for cargo transportation between the two systems. The Brewer Company agreed after some agreements, and the megaship was sent to Indri for preparing.</h2>
  <h2>Over the next few weeks, the Nova Science Team and Iron Phoenix Enterprise representatives visited each other's systems and opened embassies. They shared ideas and technologies, and the partnership blossomed into something even more significant than they had imagined.</h2>
  <h2>Harrison was thrilled with the progress they had made, and he couldn't wait to see what the future held for their joint efforts. With the Bulk-Class megaship, the transportation of goods between the two systems became much more efficient, and the economies of both systems thrived.</h2>
  <h2>In the end, Harrison had achieved what he always wanted - Achieving diplomatic relations with Colonia. The partnership between Nova Science Team and Iron Phoenix Enterprise had brought about a new era of cooperation and growth that would benefit both systems for generations to come.</h2>

The Xelabara Republic Party had been caught illegally transporting extracted minerals from the system, without the agreement of all parties involved. This had caused great damage to the extraction economy, hindering the industrial progress of the system. As a result, Tirada Jet Comms Limited and Indri Life PLC had spent many documents to Scientific Assembly, calling for action to be taken against the Republic Party.</h2>
    <h2>News of this illegal activity had angered the Nova Science Team, the controlling faction of the Indri system.

The Nova Science Team threatened to close diplomatic relations with the Republic Party and demanded that they leave the Indri system or face lethal forced removal.</h2>
    <h2>The Xelabara Republic Party knew that they couldn't afford to face the Nova Science Team head-on. They knew that their forces were not strong present in the system enough to stand up against Nova Science Team Security Division. As a result, they made the decision to abandon the Indri system, hoping to avoid any unnecessary losses.</h2>
    <h2>However, the Nova Science Team was not willing to let them go without a fight. They had already suffered damage at the hands of the Republic Party and were determined to retrieve as much of the transported goods as possible. The Security Division began stopping suspected cargo ships, searching for any illegal goods that might be on board.

      This caused great disruption to the mineral transfer operations in the system. Many traders were hesitant to transport goods, for fear of being stopped and searched by the Nova Science Team. The flow of minerals to Tetone was temporarily stopped due to the circumstances. AKB-658 Sagan-class Traveller was blockaded from leaving system until further inspections done.</h2>

But before that, they approached a military settlement where they were met with a very tense atmosphere. Without any support, Harrison was escorted to his cell, where he was supposed to stay temporarily until they were sent to the Megaship where he would spend 20 years of his life.</h2>
    <h2>However, Harrison had a hidden sensor in his suit, and his best friend, Gerard Aghaius, never left his side. It was time to get Harrison out of the prison. Gerard called for an emergency meeting of the Classis IV, "Satus Fidelis", and proposed various plans for a military settlement raid. Fleet Carrier Ararat was equipped with all the necessary equipment for a full-scale raid, and it had been armored to the teeth. They decided to name the operation "Black Thunder".</h2>
    <h2>Harrison's cell had one guard who looked brand new, and he was surprised why a non-opt was put to guard such a terrorist, according to the feds. Harrison tried to put time by asking the guard how long he had been working there and if he enjoyed working in the prison.</h2>

    <h2>Satus Fidelis didn't slow down, and Ararat was armed to the teeth with military Cutters and Corvettes for air combat. They prepared to advance into the system where Harrison was being held. In Hyperjump, Destiny shared geodata and environmental health with Ararat for better coordination and to locate the weak points against anti-air turrets.</h2>
    <h2>Harrison hid a portable E-Breach in his room, hoping to open the door at the right moment. On the way to the dining room, he came across local hucksters who traded homemade weapons. The weapons were expensive for prison times, and it was not an option to bargain. However, during the conversation, information about another imperial prisoner slipped through.
      The old hermit, who knew this prison like the back of his hand, agreed to help Harrison and promised to help him free himself. After the prisoners were dispersed to their cells, Ararat arrived in the system, and the team immediately headed for the settlement. Air support was the first to go into battle, bombarding important places. Lying in his bunk and hearing the explosions, Harrison knew it was time to act. Taking out the E-Breach from under his bunk, he began to crack the door. At this time, Gerard made his way to the main building to turn off the alarm. By old methods, he gave the order to turn off all power at the same time in the power plant. There were too many explosions and shots, and panic set in. Suddenly everything in the building went dark, and the door behind the guard opened. Harrison grabbed the guard by the throat and gave him one last chance.</h2>
    <h2>The guard tried to get a weapon, and after an explosion in the deep darkness, Harrison jabbed a shiv into the guard's throat. A second later, Gerard arrived.</h2>
    <h2>Harrison - "You're Late"</h2>
    <h2>Gerard - "Next time you'll save your own "</h2>
    <h2>Harrison - "It was a pity for the kid, Stubborn"</h2>
    <h2>With a smile, shaking hands, as in the good old days, they decided to completely clean up the settlement, but there was little time, reinforcements were already on their way. At the last second, the ship docked at Ararat and vanished into hyperspace. Disappeared without noise, Izanami.... Land of Dreams...</h2>

      <h1>Izanami, Land of Dreams</h1>
      <h2>Director Dasha Adams was beyond excited to share the news with the world - Nova Science Team was joining the Independent Explorers Association, Azura Initiative, and FCOC for a grand mission to explore the Izanami Galactic Region, also known as the Land of Dreams. It was a journey of discovery that had been a long time coming, and everyone involved was eager to unravel the mysteries that lay ahead.</h2>
      <h2>The mission was to be led by Captain Hellrider, who would be accompanied by Harrison Wells, among others. Ygddrasil, the state-of-the-art Fleet Carrier, had already been prepared for the expedition, and the team was set to depart to the Great Annihilator, where they would meet up with the rest of the expedition members. From there, they would venture forth into the unknown depths of the Izanami Galactic Region.</h2>
      <h2>As for Harrison Wells, his recent return from a bloodbath in a federal settlement had not deterred him from pursuing his passion for space exploration. In fact, he had used his experience to strengthen the resolve of the Nova Technocratic Scientific Assembly, of which he was a member. He had held a long meeting with Director Dasha Adams and other members of the assembly to discuss the upcoming mission and ensure that all preparations were in order.</h2>
      <h2>During the meeting, Harrison made a bold move. He officially abolished the position of General Speaker of the Scientific Assembly, which had been a contentious issue for some time. Instead, he appointed himself as the leader of the Deep Space "Destiny Voyagers" branch, a move that was met with mixed reactions from the other members of the assembly.</h2>
