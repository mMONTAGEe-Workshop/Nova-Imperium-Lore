        <h3 style="margin-left: 25px;">The Rise of Nova Imperium</h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px;">A radical group called Nova Imperium is gaining influence throughout the Empire.

        Imperial Herald journalist Cassia Carvalho highlighted the situation:
        
        “Nova Imperium claims that to survive the Thargoid conflict, the Empire must sever contact with all other systems and concentrate on protecting itself. In recent months, the organisation has become a genuine political force.”
        
        “The group’s leader is known only as the Imperator. Dressed in an Imperial Navy uniform, he is a charismatic presence who speaks of ‘a return to the honour of the old days’ and ‘the glory of Achenar’.”
        
        “Many traditionalist citizens, unhappy with recent cross-superpower cooperation, have embraced the Imperator’s rhetoric. On several worlds, Nova Imperium’s followers hold rallies with a distinctly martial feel.”
        
        “So far there has been little response from Imperial authorities, but it is clear that Nova Imperium will soon become impossible to ignore.”</p>

          <h3 style="margin-left: 25px;">A Warning from the Imperator</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">The isolationist group Nova Imperium has broadcast a message to Imperial citizens via public media.

            The organisation’s leader, known only as the Imperator, said:
            
            “Imperial citizens, your ruler’s weakness has put you in great danger. If we are to survive the Thargoid onslaught, we must sever ties with the Federation and other, inferior powers, and concentrate on protecting our own systems.”
            
            “I call upon those who care about their Imperial birthright to support Nova Imperium. We vow to restore the Empire’s purity and strength, and to lead it into a glorious future.”
            
            Senator Denton Patreus responded with the following comment:
            
            “These extremists and their seditious agenda are not worthy of attention. So far we have been lenient with them, but this so-called Imperator would be wise not to test our patience any further.”</p>

          <h3 style="margin-left: 25px;">Report on Nova Imperium Leaked</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">A report compiled by the Imperial Internal Security Service on isolationist group Nova Imperium has been leaked.

            The Rewired news service broadcast the report in full:
            
            “This document compiles our latest intelligence on Nova Imperium, as requested. Although the group has not yet committed any crimes, its threat potential should not be underestimated. Its isolationist message resonates with those fearful of Thargoid invasion, and its rallying cry of ‘Empire for the Imperials’ aligns with the more conservative citizenry.”
            
            “We have identified the group’s leader, the Imperator, as Duke Kaeso Mordanticus, a former naval admiral from a long line of decorated veterans.”
            
            “Evidence suggests that Mordanticus still has contacts and influence in the Imperial Navy. Nova Imperium’s ships are mostly run by ex-naval crews, bound by loyalty to their former commanding officer.”
            
            “We will continue to monitor Nova Imperium and report on any developments.”</p>
