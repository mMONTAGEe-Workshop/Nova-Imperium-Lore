        <h2 style="margin-left: 25px;">Nova Paresa, originally known as Nova Imperium, is a radical Imperial organisation based in the Paresa system that espouses traditionalist and isolationist ideals. It was formed by Duke Kaeso Mordanticus, also called the Imperator, in 3304 amidst the Second Thargoid War in reaction to the Empire's cooperation with the Federation and the Alliance against the Thargoids, and supported replacing Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval with Hadrian Augustus Duval, a long-lost grandson of the late Emperor Hengist Duval.</h2>

    <h1>The Rise of Nova Imperium</h1>
    <h2>A radical group called Nova Imperium is gaining influence throughout the Empire.

        Imperial Herald journalist Cassia Carvalho highlighted the situation:
        
        “Nova Imperium claims that to survive the Thargoid conflict, the Empire must sever contact with all other systems and concentrate on protecting itself. In recent months, the organisation has become a genuine political force.”
        
        “The group’s leader is known only as the Imperator. Dressed in an Imperial Navy uniform, he is a charismatic presence who speaks of ‘a return to the honour of the old days’ and ‘the glory of Achenar’.”
        
        “Many traditionalist citizens, unhappy with recent cross-superpower cooperation, have embraced the Imperator’s rhetoric. On several worlds, Nova Imperium’s followers hold rallies with a distinctly martial feel.”
        
        “So far there has been little response from Imperial authorities, but it is clear that Nova Imperium will soon become impossible to ignore.”</h2>

    <h1>A Warning from Imperator</h1>
    <h2>The isolationist group Nova Imperium has broadcast a message to Imperial citizens via public media.

        The organisation’s leader, known only as the Imperator, said:
        
        “Imperial citizens, your ruler’s weakness has put you in great danger. If we are to survive the Thargoid onslaught, we must sever ties with the Federation and other, inferior powers, and concentrate on protecting our own systems.”
        
        “I call upon those who care about their Imperial birthright to support Nova Imperium. We vow to restore the Empire’s purity and strength, and to lead it into a glorious future.”
        
        Senator Denton Patreus responded with the following comment:
        
        “These extremists and their seditious agenda are not worthy of attention. So far we have been lenient with them, but this so-called Imperator would be wise not to test our patience any further.”</h2>

    <h1>Report of Nova Imperium Leaked</h1>
    <h2>A report compiled by the Imperial Internal Security Service on isolationist group Nova Imperium has been leaked.

        The Rewired news service broadcast the report in full:
        
        “This document compiles our latest intelligence on Nova Imperium, as requested. Although the group has not yet committed any crimes, its threat potential should not be underestimated. Its isolationist message resonates with those fearful of Thargoid invasion, and its rallying cry of ‘Empire for the Imperials’ aligns with the more conservative citizenry.”
        
        “We have identified the group’s leader, the Imperator, as Duke Kaeso Mordanticus, a former naval admiral from a long line of decorated veterans.”
        
        “Evidence suggests that Mordanticus still has contacts and influence in the Imperial Navy. Nova Imperium’s ships are mostly run by ex-naval crews, bound by loyalty to their former commanding officer.”
        
        “We will continue to monitor Nova Imperium and report on any developments.”</h2>

    <h1>Nova Imperium demand new Imperator</h1>
    <h2>Isolationist group Nova Imperium has declared its intention to install a new Emperor.

        The group’s leader, recently identified as ex-navy admiral Duke Kaeso Mordanticus and known as the Imperator, said:
        
        “The Empire has been weakened by collaborating with its enemies. Aegis drains our resources to protect foreign systems from the Thargoids, our security forces are stretched thin defending non-Imperial systems, and Princess Duval sullies her honourable name by dallying with a Federal libertine.”
        
        “Our people demand stronger leadership. We will achieve this by installing a new Emperor – one who will restore the glory of the Empire!”
        
        Political journalist Cassia Carvalho commented in The Imperial Herald:
        
        “Naturally there has been no response from Arissa Lavigny-Duval. But for many citizens, Mordanticus has articulated their unease about inter-superpower cooperation. With support for Nova Imperium increasing rapidly, a silent minority may now have found a voice.”</h2>

    <h1>Senator Support Nova Imperium</h1>
    <h2>Several Imperial senators have spoken in support of isolationist group Nova Imperium.

        Senator Pal Vespasian made the following statement:
        
        “Many of us see Nova Imperium not as extremists, but as realists. The citizenry is afraid of both Thargoid invasion and of being weakened by collaboration with foreign systems. They look to the Emperor for salvation…and she offers them none.”
        
        “We intend to invite Imperator Mordanticus to address the Senate and detail his policies. This is a historic opportunity to restore the Empire’s honour and integrity.”
        
        “Furthermore, Nova Imperium’s proposal to install a new Emperor has my full backing.”</h2>

    <h1>Nova Imperium Unveils Figurehead</h1>
    <h2>Isolationist group Nova Imperium has revealed its choice for Emperor – an eighteen year old man named Hadrian Augustus Duval.

        The group’s leader, Imperator Mordanticus, broadcast this message:
        
        “It is incumbent upon me to reveal that Hengist Duval fathered not one but two illegitimate children in his younger days. A few years before meeting Florence Lavigny, he had a brief affair with a slave in the Imperial household. When Hengist’s father discovered this, the matter was hushed up and the slave dismissed. The slave’s son went on to sire a child of his own: Hadrian Duval, grandson of Emperor Hengist Duval. Hadrian was unaware of this until we located him and genetically confirmed his lineage.”
        
        “Arissa Lavigny-Duval is a weak Emperor who must be removed. We call for Hadrian Duval to be recognised as the true heir to the throne!”
        
        The Imperial Herald’s political journalist Cassia Carvalho observed:
        
        “This announcement has shaken the Empire to its very foundations. Having Hadrian as a figurehead has rallied those hardliners more comfortable with the idea of a male Emperor. With a single stroke, Nova Imperium has gained considerable credibility and massively increased its support.”</h2>

    <h1>Hadrian Duval Adresses Empire</h1>
    <h2>Hadrian Augustus Duval, the long-lost grandson of Emperor Hengist Duval, has broadcast a message to the Empire:

        “I am no wealthy senator from an entitled family, but someone who has lived an ordinary life. Someone who understands the hardships faced by many Imperial citizens.”
        
        “As Hadrian Jansen, I was a poor child with no family other than my father. Together we scraped a living as independent traders. He never spoke of his past – not even when he died two years ago. That was when I inherited his ship and became a Commander myself.”
        
        “When Imperator Mordanticus informed me of my heritage, I knew I had to accept my identity as a Duval. I’ve seen how diminished the Empire has become, and I know that new leadership is sorely needed.”
        
        “I ask you to honour the legacy of the Duval bloodline. With Nova Imperium, let’s save the Empire we love.”</h2>

    <h1>Aisling Duval Rejects Nova Imperium</h1>
    <h2>Princess Aisling Duval has publicly rejected the isolationist group Nova Imperium and its figurehead, Hadrian Duval:

        “These extremists cause only division. Hadrian may well be the grandson of Hengist Duval, but that hardly makes him suited to the throne. Arissa has been silent for too long – she must act quickly to resolve this volatile situation.”
        
        Senator Zemina Torval responded:
        
        “Much to my surprise, I find myself in agreement with Princess Duval. The notion of an independent pilot becoming ruler of the Empire is preposterous. I am confident that the Emperor will respond accordingly.”
        
        Despite this united front, Senator Pal Vespasian stated:
        
        “Many senators are willing to recognise Hadrian Duval as Emperor-in-waiting. Nova Imperium is now a legitimate political movement with several million supporters. The only way the Empire will survive is by accepting the Imperator’s proposals.”</h2>

    <h1>An Heir to the Imperial Throne</h1>
    <h2>Imperial senators supporting the isolationist group Nova Imperium have demanded that Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval acknowledge its figurehead, Hadrian Augustus Duval.

        Senator Eloise Winterstone proclaimed to the Senate:
        
        “The Imperial family must officially recognise Hadrian Duval as one of its own. Given that the Emperor has no children, such an act would secure the future of the Duval bloodline.”
        
        Chancellor Anders Blaine replied:
        
        “Our official position is that Nova Imperium is a fringe organisation with no right to determine policy. We have no more to say on the matter.”
        
        Political journalist Cassia Carvalho wrote in The Imperial Herald:
        
        “With the possibility of civil war increasing, the suggestion that Arissa accept Hengist Duval’s grandson as an heir feels like a reasonable compromise. Her lack of response so far has led to accusations of weakness, with many calling on her to step down and for Hadrian Duval to be instated as sovereign ruler.”</h2>

        Prime Minister Edmund Mahon told the Alliance Assembly:
        
        “The civil unrest in the Empire is an internal matter, but it would be a major concern if it resulted in a policy change regarding inter-superpower cooperation. We are therefore watching the situation closely.”
        
        In Congress, President Zachary Hudson said:
        
        “If Nova Imperium comes to power and the Empire ceases contributions to Aegis, our combined defences against the Thargoid threat will be jeopardised. In such a case, the Federation would be forced to intervene in order to safeguard humanity’s future.”
        
        Independent sources have confirmed that Federal Navy resupplies have increased in frequency. Fleet manoeuvres have also taken place in regions bordering Imperial territory.</h2>

        Senator Denton Patreus made this statement:
        
        “We have evidence that this seditious organisation is amassing an armada in its home system. It consists of ships crewed by Imperator Mordanticus’s ex-Navy followers, as well as the private vessels of many misguided citizens.”
        
        “As Admiral of the Fleet, I order Nova Imperium to disperse its forces immediately or face the consequences.”
        
        The Imperial Herald’s Cassia Carvalho commented:
        
        “Widespread support for Hadrian Duval has led to Nova Imperium amassing its fleet in a very short time. The challenge for the Imperial Navy is to quash this threat without it being seen as a massacre of Imperial citizens, which can only fuel further rebellion.”</h2>

        Chancellor Anders Blaine made a pronouncement on behalf of Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval:
        
        “With its fleet destroyed, Nova Imperium’s seditious agenda has been halted. The so-called Imperator, Duke Kaeso Mordanticus, will be brought before the Senate on Friday the 25th of January to answer charges of treason against the Empire.”
        
        Political journalist Cassia Carvalho commented in The Imperial Herald:
        
        “For the emperor to assemble the entire Senate is a rare occurrence. It seems likely that she will make an example of Mordanticus, perhaps with a public trial.”

        Political journalist Cassia Carvalho was at the scene:
        
        “Imperator Mordanticus was led into Senate House in shackles but still defiant. All rose as Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval entered, attended by Senator Denton Patreus. The Emperor and Patreus approached Mordanticus silently, whereupon Patreus executed the Imperator with his personal sidearm.”
        
        “Suddenly, the Imperial Guard opened fire, gunning down senators Pal Vespasian and Eloise Winterstone, and others who had supported the isolationist cause.”
        
        “Once the initial shock had subsided, the Emperor stood over the Imperator’s body. In a clear voice she announced: ‘There is no Nova Imperium. There is only the Empire.’”
        
        “I have since heard reports of mass arrests and further public executions across Capitol. The rumour is that Patreus placed agents among Nova Imperium strongholds, which are now being eliminated from within. This may be the start of an Empire-wide purge.”</h2>
