        <h3 style="margin-left: 25px;">The Rise of Nova Imperium</h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px;">A radical group called Nova Imperium is gaining influence throughout the Empire.

        Imperial Herald journalist Cassia Carvalho highlighted the situation:
        
        “Nova Imperium claims that to survive the Thargoid conflict, the Empire must sever contact with all other systems and concentrate on protecting itself. In recent months, the organisation has become a genuine political force.”
        
        “The group’s leader is known only as the Imperator. Dressed in an Imperial Navy uniform, he is a charismatic presence who speaks of ‘a return to the honour of the old days’ and ‘the glory of Achenar’.”
        
        “Many traditionalist citizens, unhappy with recent cross-superpower cooperation, have embraced the Imperator’s rhetoric. On several worlds, Nova Imperium’s followers hold rallies with a distinctly martial feel.”
        
        “So far there has been little response from Imperial authorities, but it is clear that Nova Imperium will soon become impossible to ignore.”</p>

          <h3 style="margin-left: 25px;">A Warning from the Imperator</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">The isolationist group Nova Imperium has broadcast a message to Imperial citizens via public media.

            The organisation’s leader, known only as the Imperator, said:
            
            “Imperial citizens, your ruler’s weakness has put you in great danger. If we are to survive the Thargoid onslaught, we must sever ties with the Federation and other, inferior powers, and concentrate on protecting our own systems.”
            
            “I call upon those who care about their Imperial birthright to support Nova Imperium. We vow to restore the Empire’s purity and strength, and to lead it into a glorious future.”
            
            Senator Denton Patreus responded with the following comment:
            
            “These extremists and their seditious agenda are not worthy of attention. So far we have been lenient with them, but this so-called Imperator would be wise not to test our patience any further.”</p>

          <h3 style="margin-left: 25px;">Report on Nova Imperium Leaked</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">A report compiled by the Imperial Internal Security Service on isolationist group Nova Imperium has been leaked.

            The Rewired news service broadcast the report in full:
            
            “This document compiles our latest intelligence on Nova Imperium, as requested. Although the group has not yet committed any crimes, its threat potential should not be underestimated. Its isolationist message resonates with those fearful of Thargoid invasion, and its rallying cry of ‘Empire for the Imperials’ aligns with the more conservative citizenry.”
            
            “We have identified the group’s leader, the Imperator, as Duke Kaeso Mordanticus, a former naval admiral from a long line of decorated veterans.”
            
            “Evidence suggests that Mordanticus still has contacts and influence in the Imperial Navy. Nova Imperium’s ships are mostly run by ex-naval crews, bound by loyalty to their former commanding officer.”
            
            “We will continue to monitor Nova Imperium and report on any developments.”</p>

          <h3 style="margin-left: 25px;">Nova Imperium Demands new Imperator</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">Isolationist group Nova Imperium has declared its intention to install a new Emperor.

            The group’s leader, recently identified as ex-navy admiral Duke Kaeso Mordanticus and known as the Imperator, said:
            
            “The Empire has been weakened by collaborating with its enemies. Aegis drains our resources to protect foreign systems from the Thargoids, our security forces are stretched thin defending non-Imperial systems, and Princess Duval sullies her honourable name by dallying with a Federal libertine.”
            
            “Our people demand stronger leadership. We will achieve this by installing a new Emperor – one who will restore the glory of the Empire!”
            
            Political journalist Cassia Carvalho commented in The Imperial Herald:
            
            “Naturally there has been no response from Arissa Lavigny-Duval. But for many citizens, Mordanticus has articulated their unease about inter-superpower cooperation. With support for Nova Imperium increasing rapidly, a silent minority may now have found a voice.”</p>

          <h3 style="margin-left: 25px;">Nova Imperium Unveils Figurehead</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">Isolationist group Nova Imperium has revealed its choice for Emperor – an eighteen year old man named Hadrian Augustus Duval.

            The group’s leader, Imperator Mordanticus, broadcast this message:
            
            “It is incumbent upon me to reveal that Hengist Duval fathered not one but two illegitimate children in his younger days. A few years before meeting Florence Lavigny, he had a brief affair with a slave in the Imperial household. When Hengist’s father discovered this, the matter was hushed up and the slave dismissed. The slave’s son went on to sire a child of his own: Hadrian Duval, grandson of Emperor Hengist Duval. Hadrian was unaware of this until we located him and genetically confirmed his lineage.”
            
            “Arissa Lavigny-Duval is a weak Emperor who must be removed. We call for Hadrian Duval to be recognised as the true heir to the throne!”
            
            The Imperial Herald’s political journalist Cassia Carvalho observed:
            
            “This announcement has shaken the Empire to its very foundations. Having Hadrian as a figurehead has rallied those hardliners more comfortable with the idea of a male Emperor. With a single stroke, Nova Imperium has gained considerable credibility and massively increased its support.”</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">Hadrian Augustus Duval, the long-lost grandson of Emperor Hengist Duval, has broadcast a message to the Empire:

            “I am no wealthy senator from an entitled family, but someone who has lived an ordinary life. Someone who understands the hardships faced by many Imperial citizens.”
            
            “As Hadrian Jansen, I was a poor child with no family other than my father. Together we scraped a living as independent traders. He never spoke of his past – not even when he died two years ago. That was when I inherited his ship and became a Commander myself.”
            
            “When Imperator Mordanticus informed me of my heritage, I knew I had to accept my identity as a Duval. I’ve seen how diminished the Empire has become, and I know that new leadership is sorely needed.”
            
            “I ask you to honour the legacy of the Duval bloodline. With Nova Imperium, let’s save the Empire we love.”</p>
