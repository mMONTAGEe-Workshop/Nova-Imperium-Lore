        <h2 style="margin-left: 25px;">The noble House of Salus was formed in 2360, and Francis I. of Salus was crowned archduke within the newly formed Empire just a few years after. His son Francis II. was also the first archduke of Salus to represent the House in the Imperial senate. House Salus is renowned within the Empire for specialising in exploration, and colonising newly found systems on the outskirts of Imperial space. For many generations House Salus was content with settling new systems, and then leave the administration of said systems in the capable hands of newly formed Empire aligned factions.</h2>
        <h2 style="margin-left: 25px;">The current reigning matriarch of House Salus changed this however. Archduchess Magdalena Sophia von Salus settled the House in Gallemi, from which they now plan their next expansions, and colonisation efforts. The House remains one of the few traditionalist, and isolationist Imperial houses. So her ascension as the first matriarch of House Salus, and especially her departure from a nomadic and fleet-based lifestyle were highly controversial. Nevertheless the House has prospered in Gallemi, without sacrificing its future colonisation prospects.</h2>
